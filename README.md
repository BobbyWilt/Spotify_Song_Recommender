# Spotify Song Recommender - WIP
This project leverages spotify's api and provided user playlists to create and tune a neural network model that generates song recommendaitons based off of song data in provided playlists.  The notebook python files can be copied and used by anyone to create their own song-recommender using their song data.

See the model notebook file for instructions on code usage.  As a general requirement, a user will need to have their own spotify account and spotify developer account (detailed steps in notebook).  The development account is free and easy to obtain.

This project is currently work-in-progress whereby the code may not run completely from start to finish.  The notebook file will be cleaned up and streamlined over the next few weeks to allow for ease of use and relatively bug-free.  Currently the notebook file will be able to read, process, generate a model, generate song predictions, and visualize song data from user provided playlists.  Song recommendation settings and the model building setup still need some work.
